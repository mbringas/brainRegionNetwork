Network analysis of brain region activity in different states of wakefulness and sleep

Data was collected and originally analized in an article by [Tagliazucchi et al](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24811386/). Networkx library
in Python was used to conduct analyses (connectivty, node characteristics, network characteristics) and [communities library](https://pypi.org/project/community/) to detect communities.

Functional MRI (fMRI) measurements in different regions of the brain measure activity of subject in different states of wakefulness and sleep.
